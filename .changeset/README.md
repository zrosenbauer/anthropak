# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## What's a changeset?

A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It holds three bits of information:

- What we need to release
- What version we are releasing packages at (using a semver bump type)
- A changelog entry for the released packages

## How do I add a changeset?

Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository.
